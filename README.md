# Notes
What I wanted to do was clone,  no-code, low code, Python framework a Notebook that met the requirement of a creating and pickling a model trained using movie lens ratings + text, save that as a Python script and overlay the load, task boilerplate on that - then with that attributed exploit in the bank  explore and improve
I failed to exploit as I could not find a fully suitable clone or environment in github (should have tried gitlab and model zoo's too) , Kaggle, or Medium 
Did find Google and Microsoft recommenders and papers with code and other notebooks using a slightly different version of movie lens data set - I should have grokked fast that a few simply renames of the actual datset made these reusable - could have used Azure ML studio and completed the task with drag, drop & fill in the box but not saved that as Python script readily
The Python recommendation libraries (e.g. Surprise) did all but the text part of the task in a few lines but extending them looked gnarly â€¦
I have learned much about Kaggle, Github, Collab and Recommender systems
Next time then :-)
