# Notes
* What I wanted to do was clone,  no-code, low code, Python framework a Notebook that met the requirement of a creating and pickling a model trained using movie lens ratings + text, save that as a Python script and overlay the load, task boilerplate on that - then with that attributed exploit in the bank  explore and improve
* I failed to exploit as I could not find a fully suitable clone or environment in GitHub (should have tried GitLab and model zoo's too) , Kaggle, or Medium 
* Did find Google and Microsoft recommenders and papers with code and other notebooks using a slightly different version of movie lens data set - I should have grokked fast that a few simply renames of the actual datset made these reusable - could have used Azure ML studio and completed the task with drag, drop & fill in the box but not saved that as Python script readily
* The Python recommendation libraries (e.g. Surprise) did all but the text part of the task in a few lines but extending them looked gnarly â€¦
* So finally hurried e.g. hard-coding rather than parameterisation
* I have learned much about Kaggle, Github, Collab and Recommender systems
* So many examples just use the core numeric user, movie and ratings fields
* Next time then :-)
* Next time start with Git repo and scrapbook-style record all research, coding and related thoughts  

# Postscript - other approaches to try:-
* Google
  * Sorted search
* fast.ai
  * Tabular or collab
* Recsys library
  * Old and cold  
* scikit-learn
  * Supports text
  * Surprise
    * Sparse
* Turi Create
* Vowpal Wabbit 
* XGBoost?
